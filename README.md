# 🔗 Automated LinkedIn Connector

## 📌 Overview  
This JavaScript script automates sending LinkedIn connection requests by:  
- Finding and clicking all available "Connect" buttons  
- Handling the "Send Without a Note" pop-up  
- Moving to the next page when no "Connect" buttons remain  
- Repeating the process until all connections are sent  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. The script searches for "Connect" buttons and clicks them.  
2. If a pop-up appears asking to "Send Without a Note," it clicks that option.  
3. If no "Connect" buttons are found, it clicks the "Next" button to navigate to the next page.  
4. The process continues until no more "Connect" or "Next" buttons are available.
